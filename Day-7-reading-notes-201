### From the Duckett HTML book:

#### Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145)

- The **table** element is used to add **tables** to a webpage.
- A **table** is drawn out of a **row**. Each row is created with a **tr** element.
- **Inside** each **row** there are a number of **cells** represented by the **td** element **or th if it is a header.
- You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the **rowspan** and **colspan** attributes.
- For long tables you can split the table into a **thead**, **tbody** and **tfoot**

### From the Duckett JS Book:

#### Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)

- **Functions allows you to group a set of related statements together to represent a **single** task.
- Functions can take **parameters** amd may return a **value**.
- An **object** is a **series** of **variables** and **functions** that represent something - from the world around you.
- In an **object** , **variables** are known as **properties** of the object while **functions** are known as **methods** of the **object**.
- **Web Browsers** implement objects that **represent** **both** the **browser window** and the **document** loaded into the browser window.
- **Javascript** also has several built-in objects such as **String, Number, Math and Date**. Their properties and methods offer **functionality** that help you write scripts.
- **Arrays and objects** can be used to create complex datasets and **both** can contain the other.
