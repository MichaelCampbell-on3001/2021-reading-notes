### [Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

> “Complexity is anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify." — John Outerhout

**What is functional programming?**
*Functional programming* is a programming paradigm — a *style* of building the *structure* and *elements* of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and *avoids* changing-state and mutable data.

What is a *pure* function?
+ It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).
+ It does not cause any observable side effects.
