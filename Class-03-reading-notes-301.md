### Javascript Templating Language and Engine: Mustache.js with Node and Express
**Javascript Templating** The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.
**Mustache** is often referred to as *“logic-less”* because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. 

Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.
It is also considered the base for JavaScript templating. And, since mustache supports various languages, we don’t need a separate templating system on the server side.
