## Reading notes day 8
### From the Duckett HTML book:
#### HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)
## Layout
- **div** elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in a normal flow unless you specify _relative_, _absolute_ or**fixed** positioning.
- The **float** property moves content to the *left* or *right* of the page and can be used to - - - create multiple column layouts. (Floated items require a *defined* width.
-Pages can be a **fixed** width or have a more liquid or *strechy* layouts.
- **Designers** keep pages within **960-1000** pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top _600_ pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- **Grids** help create *professional* and *flexible* designs.
- **CSS Frameworks** provide *rules* for common tasks.
- You can include *multiple* CSS files in one page.
