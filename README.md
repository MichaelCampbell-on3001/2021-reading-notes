## Growth mindset ##
>To me,having a growth mindset means having the ability to pursue new challenges and expect them to be dificult. 
It means you know that you will struggle, but are willing to submit to the to the task at hand and pursue multiple avenues to meet your goal.  

1. Don't get discouraged from failure.
1. Always ask for help.
1. Remember to refelct on what you have learned.
  
~~coding is hard~~
## Markdown ##
Markdown is a striped-down programing language that can be used with the tools found at www.github.com
It allows the user to easily add formatting and style to the text on their page. For example, Markdown allows you to quickly add headers, coloumns and tables to your page. It also enables the user to easily add **bold**, *italaics* and ~~strike outs to text~~.
