## Growth mindset ##
To me,having a growth mindset means having the ability to pursue new challenges and expect them to be dificult. 
It means you know that you will struggle, but are willing to submit to the to the task at hand and pursue multiple avenues to meet your goal.  
##*Text Editors##
Document in your reading-notes the different classifications of text editors, and why itâ€™s important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code.
A text editor, while it is another piece of software, it becomes a personal choice as to which one you choose. Like a Jedi chooses a lightsaber, a developer chooses their text editor. There is a variety of text editors, some that come preinstalled on computers and some that require downloading onto your device.
