## Markdown ##
Markdown is a striped-down programing language that can be used with the tools found at www.github.com
It allows the user to easily add formatting and style to the text on their page. For example, Markdown allows you to quickly add headers, coloumns and tables to your page. It also enables the user to easily add **bold**, *italaics* and ~~strike outs to text~~.
