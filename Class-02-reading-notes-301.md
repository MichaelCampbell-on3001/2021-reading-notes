+ jQuery is a Javascript file you include in your page.
+ Once included, it makes it faster and easier to write cross-browser javascript, based on two steps.
1. Using CSS-style selectors to collect one or more nodes from the DOM tree.
1. Using jQuery’s built-in methods to work with the elements in that selection.

+ Jquery’s CSS style selector syntax makes it **easier** to select elements to work with. It also has methods that make it easier to traverse the DOM. 
+ JQuery makes it easier to handle events because the vent methods 
work across all browsers.
+ jQuery offers methods that nake it quik and simple to achieve a range of tasks that JavaScript programmers commonly need to perform.


## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
**1. Greater efficiency**
Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product). So, in the long-run, it’s often actually more efficient than two people working on separate features. 

**2. Engaged collaboration**
When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work. Another important aspect of learning to program is knowing when to ask for help. 

**3. Learning from fellow students**
Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. 

**4. Social skills**
Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities. Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal skills. 

**5. Job interview readiness**
A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen. They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base. By doing so, companies can get a better feel for how an applicant will fit into the team and their collaboration style.

**6. Work environment readiness**
Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.

1. Basic Sleectors
1. Hierarchy
1. Basic Filters
1. Content Filters
1. Visibility Filters
1. Child Filters 
1. Attribute Filters

### Doing Things with your selection
+ Once you have selected the elements you want to work with (and they are in a jQuery methods listed on thse two pages perform tasks on those elements.

1. Content Filters
1. Finding Elements
1. Dimension/Position
