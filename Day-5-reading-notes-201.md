Reading notes day 5
###From the Duckett HTML book:
##### Chapter 5: “Images” (pp.94-125)
The *img* element is used to add images to a webpage.
You **must** use a *src* attribute to indicate the source of an image and an *alt* attribute to describe the content of an image.
You should save images at the size you want to use them on the webpage and in the appropriate format.
Photographs are best saved as *JPEGS*, *illustrations and *logos* that use flat colors are better saved as *GIFs*.
###From the Duckett HTML book:
##### Chapter 11: “Color” (pp.246-263)
**Color** not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
There are 3 ways to specify color in CSS: *RGB values*, *hex codes*, and *color names*.
**Color pickers** can help you find the color you want.
It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise  people will not be able to read your content).
**CSS** has introduced an extra value for *RGB* colors to indicate *opacity*.
**CSS** also allows you to specify colors as **HSL** values with an optional opacity value. Known as **HSLA**.




###From the Duckett HTML book:
##### Chapter 12: “Text” (pp.264-299)
There are *poperties* to control the choice of *font*, *size*, *weight*, *style* and *spacing*.
There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.
If you want to use a *wider range* of typefaces there are *several* options, but you have to have the right license to use them.
You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the *left*, *right* ,* center* or *justified*. It can also be *indented*.
*You* can use **psuedo-classes** to change the style of an element when the user hovers over or clicks on the text, or when they have visited a link.
