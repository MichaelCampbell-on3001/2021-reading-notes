# NODE.JS
## [An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/) 
### What is Node.js
**Node.js** is a *JavaScript runtime* built on **Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine**. It can adobe be described as an *event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime* that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and **libuv library**. 
### But what is the V8 JavaScript Engine?
The **V8 engine** is the *open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi.* It was designed with performance in mind and **is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code** that your computer can execute.
### “Hello, World!” the Node.js Way
In **terminal** create a new file `hello.js` and copy in the following code:
`console.log("Hello, World!");`


You **should** see 
`node hello.js`
### Fun Fact!

*There are over **1,000,000** packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week!*
### What Is Node.js Used For?
**Node.js** was designed to *automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application*. These **build tools** come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. **They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.**

### Fun Fact!
*Node.js allows the developer to Run JavaScript on the Server!*

### What Kind of Apps Is Node.js Suited To?
**Node.js** is best suited for developing *chat sites, or apps such as CodeShare, where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else*. It’s also a good fit for **building APIs** where you’re handling lots of requests to perform operations on a database Or for sites involving **data streaming**, as Node makes it possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded.

#### In summary Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library. It can be used to develop apps that feature real time interaction.
## [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)
1. **Greater efficiency** - Research indicates that pair programming **takes slightly longer**, but **produces higher-quality code** that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product). 
2. **Engaged collaboration** - *It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work. *
3. **Learning from fellow students** - The *less experienced developer* benefits from the *experienced* developer’s knowledge and guidance, and the latter benefits from explaining the topic in their own words, further solidifying their own understanding.
4. **Social skills** - When just grabbing the keyboard and taking over isn’t an option, getting good at finding the right words is a skill unto itself. **This has long-term career impacts**. As much as employers want strong programmers, they know it’s essential to hire people who can work well with others.
5. **Job interview readiness** - The **ability to work with and learn from others** and stellar **communication skills** are as (or more!) important to a company than specific technical skills. Pair programming strengthens all of those skills.
6. **Work environment readiness** - Many companies that utilize **pair programing** expect to **train fresh hires from CS-degree programs** on how they operate to actually deliver a product.
