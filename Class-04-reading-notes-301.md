### CSS Grid Reference
CSS Grid Layout (aka “Grid”), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces.
To get started you have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid, set the column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows, and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and grid-row.
**Grid Container**: The element on which display: grid is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items. In this example container is the grid container.
**Grid Item**: The children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container. Here the item elements are grid items, but sub-item isn’t.
