### MongoDB

**Mongodb** is one of the most popular document based **NoSQL databases** as it stores data in **JSON** like documents. It is a **non-relational database** with *dynamic schema*.

**Speed**: For simple queries, it gives good performance, as all the related data are in single document which eliminates the join operations.

**Scalability**: It is horizontally scalable i.e. you can reduce the workload by increasing the number of servers in your resource pool instead of relying on a stand alone resource.

**Manageable**: It is easy to use for both developers and administrators. This also gives the ability to shard database

**Dynamic Schema**: Its gives you the flexibility to evolve your data schema without modifying the existing data

**NoSQL databases** are *often* compared by various *non-functional criteria*, such as scalability, performance, and consistency. This aspect of NoSQL is well-studied both in practice and theory because specific non-functional properties are often the main *justification* for **NoSQL** usage and fundamental results on **distributed** systems like the **CAP theorem** apply well to *NoSQL systems.*
