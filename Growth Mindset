##Growth mindset
To me,having a growth mindset means having the ability to pursue new challenges and expect them to be dificult. It means you know that you will struggle, but are willing to submit to the to the task at hand and pursue multiple avenues to meet your goal.

Donâ€™t get discouraged from failure.
Always ask for help.
Remember to refelct on what you have learned.
