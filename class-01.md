## HTML chapter 8 “Extra Markup” (p. 176-199)
* __Doctypes__ tell browsers what type of HTML you are using
* You can add comments to your code between the __&lt!--and -- &gt__ markers.

## HTML CHAPTER 17 PAGES 428-451
* __HTML5__  elements indicate the purpose of the different parts of a web page and help describe the structure.
* The elements provide clearer code 
* Older browsers need to be told which elements are block level elements.
* Extra Javascript is needed if the browser is very old
* The __&lt Header and Footer &gt__ elements can be used for the top and bottom of the page _AND_ the top and bottom of a section of the web page.
* The __&lt Nav &gt__ element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as primary navigation.
*__&lt Articles &gt__ elements act as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
*__&lt Asides &gt__ have two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an article element or not. When it is inside an article it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential. When it is outside an article it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.
*__&lt Sections &gt__ group related content together, typically each section would have its own heading.
* The purpose of the __&lt hgroup &gt__ element is to group together one or more __&lt H1  &gt__through__&lt H6  &gt__ elements so they are treated as one.

## Process and Design
Ask yourself who, what, why and how when developing a site. 
* Who is visiting the site?
* Why are they visiting?
* What the visitor needs and what are they trying to achieve?
* As well as how often they visit the site.
When developing for a client, it is important to narrow your target audience. Determine **who** your target audience is. Is your audience an individual or a company? If your target audience is an individual narrow your scope by determining a few more factors.  A few factors include occupation, geographical location and gender. 
If your target audience is a **company** determine its size and budget as well as their mission statement.
As yourself, why would your audience want to go to your site and let that influence design and usability to attract and keep their attention.
Create a list of reasons people should come to your site. What are their motivations to visit? Compile information you need to achieve this. Stay current with any information your audience may want to see. 
How often a person visits your site determines how often you should update your information. Creating new content and having current information will encourage your audience to revisit. 
_ Site Maps _ allow you to plan a structure of a site. It is a simple diagram that shows how the site is laid out. This is where knowing the target audience comes in handy. Ensure your site map is organized as this will dictate how the user navigates the site. 
_Wire Frame_ is a simple sketch to communicate how your site could look. When wiring framing do not include any colors or intricate designs. It is more important to get your ideas out of your head and onto *paper*.  
_JS chapter 1 Pages 11-52_
_Javascript_: Scripts are a set of instructions. Scripts can run different sections of the code depending on the circumstance. To write a script you first want to state the purpose of the script and be specific. Break down the steps
Define the goal, Design the script, code each step.Computers approach a problem in a very programmatic way, meaning they follow the set of instructions they are given whether they are right or wrong.
Define the goal and design the script in a way a computer would understand. Be clear, include all necessary information and remember the end goal.
*Computers create a model of the world using data
*The models use objects to represent a physical thing. The Objects can have properties that tell us about the object; methods that perform tasks using the properties of that object;  events which are triggered when a user interacts with the computer.
*Programmers can write the code to say, “when this event happens, run that code.”
* Web browsers use HTML markup to create a  model of the webpage. Each Element creates its own node, which is a type of object.
*To make webpages interactive, you can write code that uses the browser’s model of the webpage. 
*It is best to keep javascript in its own javascript file. Java files are text files with the .js extension.
*The HTML _Scipt_ element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the Java file.
*If you view the source code of the page in the browser , the Javascript will not have changed the HTML because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
