## Reading notes day 10
###JavaScript book, Ch. 10, “Error Handling & Debugging”
+ If you understand execution contexts (which have **two** stages) and stack, you are more likely to find the error in your code.
+ **Debugging** is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of **deduction**.
+ The **console** helps narrow down the area in which the **error** is located, so you can try to find the exact error.
**Javascript** has **7** types of errors. Each creates its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a **description** of the error.
+ If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the **try**, **catch**, **finally** statements. Use them to give your users **helpful** feedback.
