# Tools and Terminal Usage

A **command line**, or **terminal**, is a way to interface to the system without using the traditional GUI. With a terminal, you are able to enter commands and directly communicate with the computer and receive *almost* instant feedback.
The command prompt is full access to your machine, its files and your **github pages**.
Opening a terminal can be easy, but it can send you into the learning pit. Donâ€™t forget to ask for help. Every system is different, but here is how to open terminal for the Mac users:
* If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
Within a terminal you have what is known as a shell. This is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you. There are various shells available but the most common one is called bash which stands for Bourne again shell. This tutorial will assume you are using bash as your shell. As long as it prints something to the screen that ends in bash then all is good.system variable stating your current shell. echo is a command which is used to display messages.
## Short Cut
When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times. You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want.
## Terminal Commands
**pwd** which stands for Print Working Directory. (You'll find that a lot of commands in linux are named as an abbreviation of a word or words describing them. This makes it easier to remember them.) The command does just that. It tells you what your current or present working directory is.
**ls** or *list* is a powerful command that can tell you everything inside a directory or folder.
**cd** change directory, allows you to literally change directories.
**Paths**  The two types of paths are absolute and relative.
Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory. You can identify them easily as they always begin with a forward slash ( / )
Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system. They will not begin with a slash.
**mkdir** creates a new directory
**touch** creates a new file
